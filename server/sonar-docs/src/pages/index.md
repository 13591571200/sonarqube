[SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org/)Â® software (previously called Sonar) is an open source quality management platform, dedicated to continuously analyze and measure technical quality, from project portfolio to method. If you wish to extend the SonarQube platform with open source plugins, have a look at our [plugin library](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/PLUG/Plugin+Library).
