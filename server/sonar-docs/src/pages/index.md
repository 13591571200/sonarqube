SonarCloud is the leading product for Continuous Code Quality online, totally free for open-source projects. It supports all major programming languages, including Java, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, C/C++ and many more. If your code is closed source, SonarCloud also offers a paid plan to run private analyses.

SonarCloud offers end-to-end integrations for teams leveraging [GitHub](/integrations/github), [VSTS](/integrations/vsts), or [Bitbucket Cloud](/integrations/bitbucketcloud) in their development processes.
