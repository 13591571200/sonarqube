## Overview

An organization is a space where a team or a whole company can collaborate across many projects.

An organization consists of:
* Projects, on which users collaborate
* [Members](/organizations/manage-team), who can have different persmissions on the projects
* [Quality Profiles](/quality-profiles) and [Quality Gates](/quality-gates), which can be customized and shared accross projects

There are 2 kind of organizations:
* **Personal organizations**. Each account has a personal organization linked to it. This is typically where open-source developers host their personal projects. It is not possible to delete this kind of organization.
* **Standard organization**. This is the kind of organization that users want to create for their companies or for their open-source communities. As soon as you want to collaborate, it is a good idea to create such an organization.

Organizations can be on:
* **Free plan**. This is the default plan. Every project in an organization on the free plan is public.
* **Paid plan**. This plan unlocks the ability to have private projects. Go to the "Billing" page of your organization to upgrade it to the paid plan.
