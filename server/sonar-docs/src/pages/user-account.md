As a <!-- sonarqube -->SonarQube<!-- /sonarqube --><!-- sonarcloud -->SonarCloud<!-- /sonarcloud --> user you have your own space where you can see the things that are relevant to you:

## Home Page

It gives you a summary of:

* your Groups
* your SCM accounts

## Security

In addition to being able to change your password, if your instance is not using a 3rd party authentication mechanism such as LDAP or any OAuth provider (GitHub, Google Account, ...), you can manage your own [authentication tokens](/user-token).

You can create as many Token as you want. Once a Token is created, you can use it to publish analysis to a project where you have the [execute analysis](/security/authorization) permission.
