/**
 * This extension point allows to change project structure at runtime. It is executed once during task startup.
 * Some use-cases :
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Add sub-projects which are not defined in batch bootstrapper. For example the C# plugin gets the hierarchy
 *   of sub-projects from the Visual Studio metadata file. The single root pom.xml does not contain any declarations of
 *   modules</li>
 *   <li>Change project metadata like description or source directories.</li>
 * </ul>
